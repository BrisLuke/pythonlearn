Coursera - Programming for Everybody - Charles Severance, University of Michigan

This is the 10 week course I am taking.  I will be posting my efforts here.

"This course aims to teach everyone to learn the basics of programming computers. 
The course has no pre-requisites and avoids all but the simplest mathematics. 
Anyone with moderate computer experience should be able to master the materials in this course."
